React ToDo App Project:
We provided a React template project for a todo app. Your goal is to make the ToDo App work by implementing the functionality for the components.

It should work the following way: The user can type anything in the input form, and press enter or click the "Add Item" button to add the item to the ToDo List. The todo list items should display in list format. You should then finally be able to mark items as "completed" or remove them from the list. When an item is marked as completed, have it display with a line through the text and be colored green.

When the app initially loads make sure the todo list is empty. You are free to add classes and styles, but make sure you leave the component ID's and classes provided as they are. Submit your code once it is complete and our system will validate your output.
